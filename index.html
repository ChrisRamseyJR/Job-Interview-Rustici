    INSTRUCTIONS:

    Here's a small problem that a client once asked us to solve as part of a larger project.
    The client has an existing web-based system for delivering a test containing multiple choice
    questions to a learner (the relevant parts of which are included on this page). The client
    asked us to modify this code so that the test questions are delivered in a random order every
    time a learner attempts the test. Furthermore, the order in which the answers to the questions
    are presented should also be randomized.

    The existing framework for creating and displaying a test has been provided for you below. Your
    task is to comprehend the client's code and data structure then implement the `randomizeTest`
    function to perform the randomization of the question and answer order. Please explain your work
    and thought process.

    Some background on the project from the client that may affect your solution:

    - There are over 600 of these tests deployed to hundreds of thousands of users
    - There are never more then 20 questions or so per test, each with no more than 6 answers but the
      code should be able to handle an arbitrary number of both questions and answers
    - This code is maintained by several developers in different organizations
    - The code is only required to work in all modern browsers

    When submitting your response, please rename this file to include your name.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
