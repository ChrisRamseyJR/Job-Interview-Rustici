# Job Interview Rustici
 This was a "take home" coding assignment for a job application. This was a problem where they wanted a randomizing function that would shuffle both the questions and choices for up to twenty questions. randomizeTest is the function I worked in to solve the problem. I also built onto the exisiting CSS just to make it slightly more appealing.
